a = 10
b = 2
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b: 
  print("a and b are equal")
else: 
  print("a is greater than b")

### Short Hand If. If you have only one statement to execute, you can put it on the same line as the if statement.
if a > b: print("a is greater than b")

### Short Hand If ... Else
a = 2
b = 330
print("A") if a > b else print("B")

### The Pass statement
For some reason if you want to have a if statement with no content, put in the pass statement to avoid getting an error.

a = 33
b = 200

if b > a:
  pass
